# TODO-webapp


Hi! My name is Max Gillespie. If this is your first time here, welcome! This github account is primarily for projects that I work on–feel free to check out some of the stuff I've worked on!

This webapp is a simple todo app that was built for my web development class at Washington University in St. Louis–the app is animated using bootstrap, regular css, and javascript, and interacts with a simple todo API built by our professor to create, destroy, and modify 'todo' objects.
